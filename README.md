# TD-Game3.0
The third version in my tower defense game "series"

this version is based on the previous one (unlike version 2.0 that wasn't based on the original game).
The main thing I have added is the special cannon that can target characters and shoot them instead of just fire in random directions.

just like version 2.0 there is not actual money system and there is no way to win or lose the game, its just the base (basically a ready game without the final touch ups).
